# Hi, It just example of project

###
Im making this project, to demonstrate how I am making project.
Im not good developer, I am just developer from Russia but now I try make this for my experience.
## Let's follow what I maked and what I will make
1 I skipped .env file. I think it not problem because there I just make url to my postgresql db (you can find it in main.go. dbPAth variable) . If you know GORM good, you can just rewrite this code in sqlite, postgresql, mysql etc. Without it this project dont start
2 I make main file in cmd\main\main.go. You can just see comments
3 My most important module is internal\storage - there you can find package "storage", this package is very important to working with db. In future I will use this when will make handlers
## What I plan to make in future?
1 I wanna make handlers and start server
2 I will make front-end to it
3 I will place this project in server

## I will happy if you give me the star and just comment my project. If you say where I make error or where I have problem in future, I will be happy too

I use AI for making it(no, i'm not vide-coder, hah, Just ask AI advice), so please, not be rude with my project

# Thank you for your attention
